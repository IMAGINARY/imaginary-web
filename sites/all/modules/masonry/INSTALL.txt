Requirements
============

To work with the 3.x version of masonry,
This project requires two third party libraries to be placed in your
sites/all/libraries directory.
Both are provided by David DeSandro desandro.com

The items on the Status report page ( /admin/reports/status )
will indicate if they are available and installed on your system correctly.


Masonry

and place it into

    sites/all/libraries/masonry/masonry.pkgd.min.js

JQuery Update
-------------

Download and install the Drupal JQuery Update module as usual.

In testing against the current Masonry 3.x library,
jQuery Version 1.7 works well, so choose that if you can.
