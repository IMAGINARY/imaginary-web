Salsa
===

**Salsa** is a simple yet very smart and flexible fluid layout system.  
It uses the power of Sass to provide a lightweight and semantic output.  
Salsa is perfect for both simple and complex layouts.  
if you want just a simple grid, if you have a grid with an off-grid element, or
if you just hate grids - **Salsa is just what you need**.

Salsa was originaly created as the layout system that powers [Sasson](http://drupal.org/project/sasson) v3.x
so you could also call it _Sasson's Awesome Layout System... Awesome!_


Why?
===
Because it sounds better then Sals.


Getting started
===

Requirements:

- Sass - http://sass-lang.com/
- Compass (optional, required only for the grid background) - http://compass-style.org/

Put the ```/salsa``` folder in your stylesheets directory and import it:

    @import "salsa/salsa";


Documentation
===
Not much yet, but the code is very well commented, quickly going through the
comments will get you started in no-time.  
Knowing the ```settings``` and how to use the ```grid()``` and the ```container``` 
mixins will be enough for most cases, read about those first.

Documentation and examples are coming, stay tuned.


Inspiration
===

Mostly [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) and [Zen](http://zengrids.com/) grids.  
I believe Salsa manage to combine the best of both in a much simpler system.
