##### Sasson - advanced drupal theming. #####

This is the root of your sub-theme.

It must contains your .info file in which you may edit many important 
settings like base theme, theme regions and additional style sheets and 
script files (http://drupal.org/node/171205).

Check out your theme settings page for layout and grid settings, development settings, SASS settings and more.
