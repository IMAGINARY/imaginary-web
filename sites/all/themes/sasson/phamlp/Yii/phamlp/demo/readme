This directory contains the HAML view files that replace the PHP view files
found in a Yiic created application.

Copy the files to the same directories as their PHP counterparts and enable HAML
in your configuration file by configuring it as an application component named
"viewRenderer" in the application configuration:
  array(
    'components'=>array(
      ......
      'viewRenderer'=>array(
        'class'=>'HamlViewRenderer',
        .... options ....
      ),
    ),
  )

A couple of good options while developing with are:
'ugly'=>false to get nicely formatted XHTML
'debug'=>1 to include the HAML source as comments in the XHTML
