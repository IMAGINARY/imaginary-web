##### Sasson - advanced drupal theming. #####

This is the directory for all your stylesheets,
By default it contains a single .scss file already called from your .info file but you may add as many css/scss/sass files as you want.
This is where sass will look for partials, so they should reside here, preferably in the partials folder.
You may add an RTL version or an LTR version for both of them using filename-rtl.css or filename-rtl.scss etc.
if you add a new style sheet here, you must call it from the theme .info file.
